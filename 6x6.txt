There 26 alphabet letters: A-Z/and, 10 digits: 0-9; 
this makes for a total of 36 characters, altogether: (26+10=36); 
each character can be placed into a 6 x 6 grid: 6 x 6 = 36.

LETTERS

    a   b   c   d   e   f

a   A   B   C   D   E   F
 
b   G   H   I   J   K   L

c   M   N   O   P   Q   R

d   S   T   U   V   W   X

e   Y   Z   0   1   2   3

f   4   5   6   7   8   9

So, to encode the text: Paul; 
we first find: P...;
then, read off the row/col letters: c,d;
next, find: A...;
then, read off the row/col letters: a,a;
next, find: U...;
then, read off the row/col letters: d,c;
next, find: L...;
then, read off the row/col letters: b,f;
thus, Paul encoded becomes:
cdaadcbf

NUMBERS

Alternatively, we could have used numbers to represent each row/column.

    1   2   3   4   5   6

1   A   B   C   D   E   F
 
2   G   H   I   J   K   L

3   M   N   O   P   Q   R

4   S   T   U   V   W   X

5   Y   Z   0   1   2   3

6   4   5   6   7   8   9

So, to encode the text: Paul; 
we first find: P...;
then, read off the row/col letters: 3,4;
next, find: A...;
then, read off the row/col letters: 1,1;
next, find: U...;
then, read off the row/col letters: 4,3;
next, find: L...;
then, read off the row/col letters: 2,6;
thus, Paul encoded becomes:
34114326

LETTERS AND NUMBERS

We could also have used a mixture of letters/numbers to represent each row/column.

    1   2   3   4   5   6

A   A   B   C   D   E   F
 
B   G   H   I   J   K   L

C   M   N   O   P   Q   R

D   S   T   U   V   W   X

E   Y   Z   0   1   2   3

F   4   5   6   7   8   9

So, to encode the text: Paul; 
we first find: P...;
then, read off the row/col letters: C,4;
next, find: A...;
then, read off the row/col letters: A,1;
next, find: U...;
then, read off the row/col letters: D,3;
next, find: L...;
then, read off the row/col letters: B,6;
thus, Paul encoded becomes:
C4A1D3B6

SYMBOLS

Alternatively, we might have used symbols to represent each row/column.

    &   *   (   )   -   +

!   A   B   C   D   E   F
 
"   G   H   I   J   K   L

£   M   N   O   P   Q   R

$   S   T   U   V   W   X

%   Y   Z   0   1   2   3

^   4   5   6   7   8   9

So, to encode the text: Paul; 
we first find: P...;
then, read off the row/col letters: £,);
next, find: A...;
then, read off the row/col letters: !,&;
next, find: U...;
then, read off the row/col letters: $,(;
next, find: L...;
then, read off the row/col letters: ",+;
thus, Paul encoded becomes:
£)!&$("+
