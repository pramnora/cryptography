There are 26 alphabet letters...which makes it possible to stick all of those letters into a: 5 x 5 grid/(5 x 5 = 25);
however, of course, if we only have 25 spaces inside of our grid; then, that means there will still be 1 letter left over;
the way we deal with this is say the last 2 letters: Y/Z; can be conjoined together to become 'one' single letter alone.

     a    b    c    d     e

1    A    B    C    D     E

2    F    G    H    I     J

3    K    L    M    N     O

4    P    Q    R    S     T

5    U    V    W    X    Y/Z

So, if we wanted to spell the name: Paul;
we would read the row(number)/column(letter):

P = 4,a
A = 1,a
U = 5,a
L = 3,b

...and, so we get...

4a1a5a3b
