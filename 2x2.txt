Binary code uses a mixture of 2 digit numbers which can be either: 1/0.

Each binary digit is called a bit: (B)inary dig(it).

The most numbers that 2 bits can hold is 4: 00/01/10/11.

This arrangement fits very well into a 2 by 2 grid(2x2=4).

      0     1

0     00    01

1     10    11

It's very interesting to note that in this particular case; 
each row/column number translates to being the same 
as the numbers contained inside of the grid itself. 

Row: 0/Column: 0 = 00 
Row: 0/Column: 1 = 01
Row: 1/Column: 0 = 10
Row: 1/Column: 1 = 11

...so, this form of encoding wouldn't work; as the code results in 'unencoded' numbers, anyway!

However, it's certainly possible to change the encoding scheme to use different names of each Row/Column;
such as: AB-AB/or, even AB-CD/-etc.

      A     B

A     00    01

B     10    11

      C     D

A     00    01

B     10    11
