Binary code uses a mixture of 2 digit numbers which can be either: 1/0.

Each binary digit is called a bit: (B)inary dig(it).

The most numbers that 2 bits can hold is 4: 00/01/10/11.

This arrangement fits very well into a 2 by 2 grid(2x2=4).

      0     1

0     00    01

1     10    11

It's very interesting to note that in this particular case; each row/column number translates to being the same as the numbers contained inside of the grid itself/in other words, they are the same. Row: 0/Column: 0 = 00; Row: 0/Column: 1 = 01/-etc.
