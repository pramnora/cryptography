There is a computing standard known as ASCII/American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

This code represents upper case letters of the alphabet as being numbers: 65-90/(ln+64).

The maths involved is fairly simple...

Letter A = position 1 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 1 + 64 = ASCII code number: 65
Letter B = position 2 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 2 + 64 = ASCII code number: 66
...
Letter Z = position 26 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 26 + 64 = ASCII code number: 90

So, my name, Paul, can be written as:

Letter P = position 16 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 16 + 64 = ASCII code number: 80
Letter A = position 1  in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 1  + 64 = ASCII code number: 65
Letter U = position 21 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 21 + 64 = ASCII code number: 85
Letter L = position 12 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 12 + 64 = ASCII code number: 76

Thus, we get...

It might also be very well worthwhile noting that in ASCII code digits: 0-9 are represented by numbers: 48-57/(ln+47);
and, also, lower case letters are represented by numbers: 97-122/(ln+96).
