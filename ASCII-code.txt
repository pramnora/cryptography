There is a computing standard known as ASCII/American Standard Code for Information Interchange.

This code represents upper case letters of the alphabet as being numbers: 65-90/(ln+64).

The maths involved is fairly simple...

Letter A = position 1 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 1 + 64 = ASCII code number: 65
Letter B = position 2 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 2 + 64 = ASCII code number: 66
...
Letter Z = position 26 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 26 + 64 = ASCII code number: 90

So, my name, Paul, can be written as:

Letter P = position 16 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 16 + 64 = ASCII code number: 80
Letter A = position 1  in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 1  + 64 = ASCII code number: 65
Letter U = position 21 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 21 + 64 = ASCII code number: 85
Letter L = position 12 in the alphabet...so, n + 64 = 12 + 64 = ASCII code number: 76

Thus, we get...

Basically, ASCII numbers range from: 0-255.

Digits: 0-9 are represented by numbers: 48-57/(ln+47);
Lower case letters are represented by numbers: 97-122/(ln+96).

It might also be very well worthwhile noting 
that ASCII is used to represent every 'visible' keyboard: 
        number/letter/symbol/function key/
        backspace/delete/spacebar: 32/exclamation mark: 33/-etc.

There are also totally 'invisible' ASCII number codes...which are, in fact, 'hidden'; 
and, therefore, cannot be quite clearly observed by merely looking at the keyboard; 
because on the keyboard those 'hidden' ASCII numbered characters
simply do NOT exist, at least, on the 'surface'!
