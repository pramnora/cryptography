Cryptography, is made up of 2 parts...

1> Coder   - (puzzle maker)
2> Decoder - (puzzle breaker)

DECODING

The decoding process usually involves finding certain specific 'patterns' which can then be used to 
break into, and, thus, help solve the code.

For example,...

01 2456 78990 012357998 01 234570843150

...if we look at the above code to see if we can discover any 'regular' types of fixed pattern;
then, it's possible to infer that...

a> The first 'signature' pattern that it's possible to quickly and easily detect is,
this code consists exclusively of 'numbers', alone;
(there are no letters/nor other symbols in there).

b> Another give away 'signature' pattern is the use of 'spaces';
in English we write words by using 'spaces' in between each word;
so, one might infer that these are 'words' in a sentence, possibly.

c> Another signature pattern which one might latch onto is...;
at least, 2 numbers are repeated which stand entirely alone, namely: '01';
so, this could represent a single letter such as the English language: 'a';
how many other frequently used 'single letter' words in the English language are there
that are written to stand entirely on their own? In fact, there are just 2: 'a'/'i';
so, '01' could mean either an: 'a'/or, an 'i', quite possibly?

And, so, decoding consists of finding patterns; 
and, then, breaking these pattens down to make some sort of sense.

ENCODING

The encoders job...is to be 'aware' of what sort of things can make a code easy to break;
namely, the use of any fixed sort of 'patterns'.

So, for example, in the above text...
01 2456 78990 012357998 01 234570843150

We can choose to, quite deliberately, take out all of the spaces...
0124567899001235799801234570843150
...and, now, the decoder doesn't know where one word starts/or, ends;
as there are no spaces to, quite clearly, indicate that.
Nor can the see any clearly repeating stand alone: 01's, anymore;
to indicate either 'a'/or,'i'.

Another thing the encoder can do is to...mix both letters/numbers...;
so, using: Alphabet letter number codes: A=01/B=02/-etc.;
change a few of these numbers into becoming letters, instead: 9=I/2=B/7=G/-etc.
01B45678I9001235G9I801234570843150
maybe, to confuse matters even more, 
include a mixture of both upper case/lower case: 2=b
01B456g8I9001235G9I801b3457084c150
...and, so on...
Now, it's much less easy to see/understand what these codes might mean;
as the patterns aren't so easily detectable and clear...? 

-----

One might also choose to 're-arrange' the code....;
by writing it backwards instead of going fowards/-etc. 

Or, possibly, every 5 characters: write it going forwards;
and, then, every next 5 characters: write it going backwards;
-etc. etc.
