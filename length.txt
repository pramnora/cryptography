One coding ingredient concerns the question of 'length'.

Basically, the 'length' can have 2 variations...either 'fixed' length/or else, 'variable' length, instead.

For example,... 
A=1/1st alphabet letter
B=2/2nd alphabet letter
C=3/3rd alphabet letter
...so using only characters: A,B,C;
we could say that each letter is encoded using a 'fixed' number key length of: 1. 

Now, if we were to prefix any encoded single number with a 0...we get...
A=01/1st alphabet letter
B=02/2nd alphabet letter
C=03/3rd alphabet letter
...so using only characters: A,B,C;
we could say that each letter is encoded using a 'fixed' number key length of: 2. 

However, it's also possible to encode letters by using a 'randomly' chosen number length series, instead...
A=27/1st alphabet letter
B=34560/2nd alphabet letter
C=9/3rd alphabet letter
...so, this kind of key length can be called: 'variable'; ranging from 1 to, possibly, even an infinite length.

Generally speaking, in computer programming a string of 'numbers/characters' can be anything up to 255 in length;
however, there is no strict rule which says one cannot join or 'con-catenate' strings together...;
thus, making a whole series of joined up strings to be any arbitrary length of your own choosing.

-----

So, for example, you could have a single letter: 'A'...;
which has been encoded as becoming a random series of 'numbers/characters' totaling 255+ in length.

This would make the code very difficult, indeed, for us humans to read...; 
however, computers -which work at 'electronic' speeds- could both read and understand it very quickly and easily;
which, in turn, implies that certain codes only computers alone are capable of creating/reading/interpreting;
and, it's for these same reasons why many coders are, in fact, also, 'computer programmers'.
