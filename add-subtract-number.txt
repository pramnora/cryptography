This rather simple encryption/decryption scheme involves...

A> Adding a number key to encode             - A=1/+5/A=6
B> Subtracting the same number key to decode - 6-5 = 1=A

Use of different random numbers to match the whole of the entire message length.

NOTE: It is necessary to keep a note of not just the encoded message itself;
      but, also, it's list of 'random numbers'; because, if either of these is lost...
      then, it would not be possible to decode, anymore?!
