If we think of a number...let's say for sheer simplicity sake the number, 10.

Then, choose any two numbers that can be combined together to make up the number: 10...
A: 1,9
B: 2,8
C: 3,7
D: 4,6
E: 5,5
...then, immediately, we can see that though there are, at least, 5 different ways to arrive at the number totalling: 10;
yet, it's not so easy to state precisely which 2 numbers were used to get there...?
It could be any of 5 different routes.

Similarly, if that number were higher in total...say, 100/or, 1000/-etc.; 
then, the amount of possible 2 number routes that could be used to get there...
would be even more.

This is a form of 'data-hiding- technique.  

Of course, it's also possible to extend this number totalling method to include say...
3 different numbers to make up the number 10:
1+3+6
...or, 4 different numbers...
2+3+1+4
-etc.

So, you could have 3 different password levels...

Level 1: 10
Level 2: C
Level 3: 37
