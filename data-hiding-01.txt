If we think of a number say for simplicyt sake, 10.

Then, choose any two numbers that can be combined together to make up the number: 10...
A: 1,9
B: 2,8
C: 3,7
D: 4,6
E: 5,5
...then, immediately, we can see that though there are, at least, 5 different ways to arrive at the number totalling: 10;
yet, it's not so easy to state precisely which 2 numbers were used to get there...?
It could be any of 5 different routes.

Similarly, if that number were higher in total...say, 100/or, 1000/-etc.; 
then, the amount of possible 2 number routes that could be used to get there...
would be even more.

This is a form of 'data-hiding- technique.
