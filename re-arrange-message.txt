Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

It's possible to re-arrange it into lines consisting of only 2 characters...

.

...we may now re-write the same line...going from top down to bottom...
first, reading downwards from the top of col 1: Tiiaertesg.
then, reading downwards again from the top of col 2: hssscemsae
and, putting these two things together onto one same line we get:

Tiiaertesg.hssscemsae

If we lowercase any obvious Capital letters: (T)/
and, also, delete all punctuation symbols/marks: (.) we get...

tiiaertesghssscemsae
