There are numerous ways to re-arrange text; and, here I will list just a few such simple methods...

-----

SWAP EVERY 2 LETTERS AROUND

Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

hTsi si s aceerm tseaseg.

Turn and capital letters into lower case;
and, deleting the obvious spaces/punctuation we get...

htsisisaceermtseaseg

RE-WRITE MESSAGE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF CHARACTERS GOING ONTO EACH LINE 

Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

It's possible to re-write it into lines consisting of only 2 characters...

Th
is
is
as
ec
re
tm
es
sa
ge
.

...we may now re-write the same line...going from top down to bottom...
first, reading downwards from the top of col 1: Tiiaertesg.
then, reading downwards again from the top of col 2: hssscemsae
and, putting these two things together onto one same line we get:

Tiiaertesg.hssscemsae

If we lowercase any obvious Capital letters: (T)/
and, also, delete all punctuation symbols/marks: (.) we get...

tiiaertesghssscemsae
