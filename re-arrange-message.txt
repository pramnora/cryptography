There are numerous ways to re-arrange text; and, here I will list just a few such simple methods...

-> REVERSE TEXT MESSAGE
-> SWAP EVERY 2 LETTERS AROUND
-> RE-WRITE MESSAGE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF CHARACTERS GOING ONTO EACH LINE 
-> USING MULTIPLE ENCODING METHODS

-----

-> REVERSE TEXT MESSAGE

If we reverse the text message by writing it backwards:

This is a secret message.

We get this, instead:

.egassemtercesasisihT

Turn any obvious capital letters into lower case;
and, deleting the obvious spaces/punctuation we get...

egassemtercesasisiht

-----

-> SWAP EVERY 2 LETTERS AROUND

Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

hTsi si s aceerm tseaseg.

Turn any obvious capital letters into lower case;
and, deleting the obvious spaces/punctuation we get...

htsisisaceermtseaseg

-> RE-WRITE MESSAGE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF CHARACTERS GOING ONTO EACH LINE 

Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

It's possible to re-write it into lines consisting of only 2 characters...

Th
is
is
as
ec
re
tm
es
sa
ge
.

...we may now re-write the same line...going from top down to bottom...
first, reading downwards from the top of col 1: Tiiaertesg.
then, reading downwards again from the top of col 2: hssscemsae
and, putting these two things together onto one same line we get:

Tiiaertesg.hssscemsae

Turn any obvious capital letters into lower case;
and, deleting the obvious spaces/punctuation we get...

tiiaertesghssscemsae

-----

-> USING MULTIPLE ENCODING METHODS

To make ciphers that much harder to break; one may opt to use 
multiple different encoding methods instead of just merely 'one'.

Let's take the message text:

This is a secret message.

1> REVERSE IT...

egassemtercesasisiht

2> SWAP EVERY 2 LETTERS AROUND

gesaestmreecasisisth

3> WRITE IT DOWN 2 LETTERS AT A TIME ON EACH LINE

ge
sa
es
tm
re
ec
as
is
is
th

RE-WRITE BOTH COLUMNS GOING VERTICALLY DOWNWARDS; THEN, JOIN

gsetreaiiteasmecsssh

...and, that's it, the same 'one' text message only this time encoded using 3 different methods.
