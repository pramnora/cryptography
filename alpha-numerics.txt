A very simple code is to use Alpha-numerics; where each individual alphabet letter becomes a number, instead.

For example,...

A=1
B=2
...
Z=26

NOTE: The codes below are arranged going 5+5=10 letters across;
so, it should be very easily to find and locate any letter/number you please.
For example, to find 16: you would just count 10+5+1 = P/-etc.

A=1  B=2  C=3  D=4  E=5      F=6  G=7  H=8  I=9  J=10
K=11 L=12 M=13 N=14 O=15     P=16 Q=17 R=18 S=19 T=20
U=21 V=22 W=23 X=24 Y=25     Z=26

Thus, the name: Paul, could be encoded as...

16,1,21,12

NOTE: If we take the numbers A=1/K=11...and, enjoin these together...we get the following numerical arrangement...
111
...however, this is very ambiguous, indeed...as is that code actually meant to be 11,1/or, 1,11...??? Answer: We don't know?!
Thus, there are two ways around this in order to quite clearly be able to distinguish one number from a next...

a> Add a separator symbol in between each number/or, set of numbers...

b> Otherwise, use what are known as digraphs, meaning 2 letter numbers, instead; 
where any single digit number is prefixed with a zero: thus, 1=01/2=02/-etc.

Thus, the name: Paul, could be encoded as...

16012112
