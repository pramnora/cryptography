If we encode using the straight forwards alphabet scheme, where...
A=01,B=02,C=03,...,Z=26
...then, decoding is rather obvious: 010203=ABC.

So, in order to make the alphabet much less predictable; 
it's possible to start the alphabet off by pre-fixing it with say your name:

Paul Ramnora

...then, we get...
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
P  A  U  L  R  M  N  O  

...now, continue on writing all the rest of the alphabet letters after your name...
01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
P  A  U  L  R  M  N  O  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  Q  S  T  V  W  X  Y  Z

NOTE: The strict rule is...to only write each letter only just, once; with no letter being repeated. 

Now, if we wish to write: ABC it's encoded as 020910 which is much less obvious.

You see we could have opted to go for an entirely 'random' arrangement of alphabet letters/numbers;
however, the problem there is how would another person know how to 'decode' it?!
Answer: It would be very difficult, indeed, having to reproduce what is a purely 'random' arrangment.

Thus, we use a 'fixed' code word to prefix the alphabet with; 
and, of course, this makes things much more easier to decipher, afterwards;
anybody who knows the original code word would be able to deciper what the message means.
